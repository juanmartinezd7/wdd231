                <p id="paragraph2">Texas is the most populous state in the South-Central region of the United States. It
                    borders Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast,
                    Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and an international border with the Mexican states
                    of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo LeÃ³n, and Tamaulipas to the
                    south and southwest. Texas has a coastline on the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast. Covering 268,596
                    square miles (695,660 km2), and with over 30 million
                    residents as of 2023, it is the second-largest state by both area and population. Texas is nicknamed
                    the Lone Star State for its former status as
                    an independent republic.</p>
